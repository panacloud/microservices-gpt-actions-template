# Microservices Custom GPT Action Template (Peotry-FastAPI-SQLModel-Postgres-Kafka-Docker)

This is a template to enable us to quickly write and develop [Custom GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction) in a [microservice pattern](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-microservices-architecture) using [Event Driver Architecture](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-driven-architecture.html).

This template will also help to test and deploy these microservices using Kubernetes and Terraform for deployment, testcontainers for testing, and Github actions for CI/CD.
